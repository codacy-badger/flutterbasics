## Startup Namer
This is a guide to creating your first Flutter app. You don’t need previous experience with Dart or 
mobile programming.

### Part 1
Here, we’ll implement a simple mobile app that generates proposed names for a startup company. The 
user can select and un-select names, saving the best ones. The code lazily generates names. As the 
user scrolls, more names are generated. There is no limit to how far a user can scroll.

What you’ll learn in part 1
* How to write a Flutter app that looks natural on both iOS and Android.
* Basic structure of a Flutter app.
* Finding and using packages to extend functionality.
* Using hot reload for a quicker development cycle.
* How to implement a stateful widget.
* How to create an infinite, lazily loaded list.

### Part 2
Here, we'll extend this app, and add the following functionality:

* Implement interactivity by adding a clickable heart icon to save favorite pairings.
* Implement navigation to a new route by adding a new screen containing the saved favorites.
* Modify the theme color, making an all-white app.
